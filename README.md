From now on, i will write some codes to realize some algorithms i learned from the lecture Machine Vision.

Today, i setup github repository.

I will write the codes as a Module in machinevision.py and in the file test.py i will test my codes using some expamples.

learn to read, show, and save image

wrote an itpl: 2d interpolation function for scaling, rotating and so on.

wrote a rgb2gray: convert colorful image into gray value image

wrote an imrotate: to rotate the Image

wrote an imscale: to scale the image in x and y direction
